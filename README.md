# Transistor Emulator
A Python-based transistor emulator designed to simulate the behavior of transistors, including thermal, electrical, and state transitions. This emulator can model various transistor characteristics and states based on input parameters, and simulate real-time behavior such as temperature changes and power dissipation.

## Features

- **Features State Transitions:** Simulates the transistorâ€™s operation across three main states:
- **Cutoff:** Transistor is off. 
- **Saturation:** Transistor is fully on.
- **Active:** Normal operating region. 
- **Thermal Simulation:** Models the temperature changes in the transistor as it dissipates power, with potential failure due to overheating.
- **Electrical Behavior:** Calculates current gain and power dissipation based on voltage inputs and transistor parameters.
- **Simulation Over Time:** Runs simulations with time steps, displaying results for each time step.
- **Rich Output:** Uses the rich library to display results in a clean, tabular format, including a progress bar for simulations.
## Installation
