Transistor Emulator
A Python-based transistor emulator designed to simulate the behavior of transistors, including thermal, electrical, and state transitions. This emulator can model various transistor characteristics and states based on input parameters, and simulate real-time behavior such as temperature changes and power dissipation.

Features
State Transitions: Simulates the transistor’s operation across three main states:

Cutoff: Transistor is off.
Saturation: Transistor is fully on.
Active: Normal operating region.
Thermal Simulation: Models the temperature changes in the transistor as it dissipates power, with potential failure due to overheating.

Electrical Behavior: Calculates current gain and power dissipation based on voltage inputs and transistor parameters.

Simulation Over Time: Runs simulations with time steps, displaying results for each time step.

Rich Output: Uses the rich library to display results in a clean, tabular format, including a progress bar for simulations.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Dependencies:
rich: For console formatting and progress bars.
Any necessary libraries for material (e.g., SILICON), transistor properties, and electrical calculations.
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Transistor-Emulator.git
cd Transistor-Emulator
Run the emulator:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The simulation will start, and you will be prompted to view the results after completion.

Example Output
The simulation will display a table like the following, showing time steps and transistor parameters:

Time (s)	State	I_C (A)	Power (W)	Temp (°C)	Status
0	Active	0.001234	0.0456	45.67	Operational
1	Cutoff	0.000000	0.0000	35.50	Operational
2	Saturation	0.003000	0.0912	75.34	Warning: Temperature High
